took from  https://github.com/leonardvandriel/caffe2_cpp_tutorial and updated to reflect caffe2 as of 10 22 2018

The rnn folder takes the rnn example from https://github.com/leonardvandriel/caffe2_cpp_tutorial and includes only the necassary files for this example. The files were updated to reflect the changes made to the Caffe2 c++ api as of 10 22 2018

I recomend reading the README.md found in aten/src/ATen/native it helped me get a better understand of how some things are working
